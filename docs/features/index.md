# Features

PoolVibes provides core features for managing your pool, with per-user data isolation.

## Authentication & User Management

Email/password authentication with cookie-based sessions. Each user's data is fully isolated — you only see your own chemistry logs, tasks, equipment, and chemicals. Admin users can manage accounts from the Admin tab.

## Dashboard

The default landing tab. Shows summary cards for water quality (readings in range), last tested date, task status (overdue/due today), and low stock chemical count. Includes pH and free chlorine trend charts (last 30 readings) with ideal range bands, plus quick-reference lists for upcoming tasks and low stock alerts.

## [Gamification](gamification.md)

Pool Health Score (0-100), testing and task completion streaks, and 8 achievement milestone badges to encourage consistent pool maintenance.

## [Water Chemistry](water-chemistry.md)

Log water test results and track parameters over time. Out-of-range values are highlighted automatically so you can see what needs attention at a glance. Generate treatment plans with specific chemical dosages based on your pool size.

## [Tasks](tasks.md)

Schedule recurring maintenance tasks with daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence. When you complete a task, the next occurrence is created automatically.

## [Equipment](equipment.md)

Track your pool equipment with manufacturer details, warranty dates, and a full service history for each piece of equipment.

## [Chemicals](chemicals.md)

Monitor your chemical inventory with stock levels, units, and low-stock alerts. Quick-adjust buttons let you update quantities without opening a form.

## [Notifications](notifications.md)

Get email and SMS alerts when maintenance tasks are due. Configure notification preferences per user from the Settings tab.
