# Features

PoolVibes provides four core features for managing your pool:

## [Water Chemistry](water-chemistry.md)

Log water test results and track parameters over time. Out-of-range values are highlighted automatically so you can see what needs attention at a glance.

## [Tasks](tasks.md)

Schedule recurring maintenance tasks with daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence. When you complete a task, the next occurrence is created automatically.

## [Equipment](equipment.md)

Track your pool equipment with manufacturer details, warranty dates, and a full service history for each piece of equipment.

## [Chemicals](chemicals.md)

Monitor your chemical inventory with stock levels, units, and low-stock alerts. Quick-adjust buttons let you update quantities without opening a form.
