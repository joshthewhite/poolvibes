# Equipment

Track your pool equipment, warranty status, and service history.

## Equipment Categories

Equipment is organized by category:

- **Pump**
- **Filter**
- **Heater**
- **Chlorinator**

## Equipment Details

Each piece of equipment tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Equipment name (e.g., "Main Pump") |
| Category | One of the categories above |
| Manufacturer | Equipment manufacturer |
| Model | Model name or number |
| Serial Number | Serial number for warranty claims |
| Install Date | When the equipment was installed |
| Warranty Expiry | Warranty end date |

## Warranty Status

PoolVibes automatically calculates whether each piece of equipment is under warranty based on the current date and the warranty expiry date. Equipment shows as either **active** or **expired** warranty status.

## Service Records

Each piece of equipment has a service history. Service records track:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Service Date | When the service was performed |
| Description | What was done |

Service records are linked to their equipment. Deleting a piece of equipment also removes all its service records.
