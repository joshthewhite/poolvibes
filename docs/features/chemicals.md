# Chemicals

Track your chemical inventory with stock levels and low-stock alerts.

## Chemical Types

Chemicals are organized by type:

- **Sanitizer** — Chlorine tablets, liquid chlorine, etc.
- **Shock** — Pool shock treatments
- **Balancer** — pH adjusters, alkalinity increasers, calcium hardness increasers
- **Algaecide** — Algae prevention and treatment
- **Clarifier** — Water clarifiers
- **Other** — Any other pool chemicals

## Stock Tracking

Each chemical tracks its current stock with a quantity and unit:

| Unit | Example |
|------|---------|
| lbs | 25 lbs of calcium hardness increaser |
| oz | 32 oz of algaecide |
| gal | 2.5 gal of liquid chlorine |
| L | 5 L of muriatic acid |
| kg | 10 kg of diatomaceous earth |

## Low-Stock Alerts

Set an alert threshold for each chemical. When the stock amount falls at or below the threshold, the chemical is flagged as low stock so you know when to reorder.

## Quick-Adjust Buttons

The chemical list includes quick-adjust buttons for incrementing and decrementing stock without opening the full edit form. Stock cannot be adjusted below zero.
